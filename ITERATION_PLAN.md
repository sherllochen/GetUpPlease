# GetUpPlease - Development Iteration Plan

## Overview
This plan breaks down development into small, demoable iterations. Each iteration builds on the previous one and delivers working functionality that can be tested immediately.

---

## Iteration 1: Basic Single Alarm üéØ
**Goal**: Create and trigger one simple alarm that can be easily dismissed

**User Story**: "As a user, I want to create one alarm that vibrates when time comes, and I can tap to dismiss it"

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Basic watch app UI with "Set Alarm" button
- [x] Time picker for setting alarm
- [x] Local notification scheduling
- [x] Simple alarm trigger with basic vibration
- [x] Tap-to-dismiss functionality
- [x] Basic "Alarm Set" / "No Alarm" status display

**Demo Scenario**: Set alarm for 2 minutes from now, wait for it to fire, dismiss with tap

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- SwiftUI watch interface basics
- Local notifications and scheduling
- Basic haptic feedback
- Watch app lifecycle

---

## Iteration 2: Multiple Alarms Management üì±
**Goal**: Support creating, editing, and managing multiple alarms

**User Story**: "As a user, I want to create multiple alarms, turn them on/off, and delete them"

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Alarm list view showing all alarms
- [ ] Add new alarm functionality
- [ ] Delete alarm (swipe or long press)
- [ ] Enable/disable toggle for each alarm
- [ ] Edit existing alarm time
- [ ] Basic alarm storage (UserDefaults or Core Data)

**Demo Scenario**: Create 3 alarms, toggle one off, edit another, delete third, show list updates

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- List views optimized for watch
- Data persistence on watchOS
- Watch-specific navigation patterns
- Swipe gestures and user interactions

---

## Iteration 3: Recurring Alarm Schedules üîÑ
**Goal**: Add support for daily/weekly recurring alarms

**User Story**: "As a user, I want to set alarms that repeat daily or on specific days"

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Recurring options in alarm creation (One-time, Daily, Custom days)
- [ ] Day picker for custom schedules (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)
- [ ] Updated alarm list showing recurrence info
- [ ] Smart scheduling logic for recurring notifications
- [ ] "Next alarm" display showing when next alarm will fire

**Demo Scenario**: Create daily 7am alarm, create weekend-only 9am alarm, show next scheduled times

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- Complex notification scheduling
- Date/time calculations
- Watch-optimized selection interfaces
- Background scheduling management

---

## Iteration 4: Basic Math Challenge System üßÆ
**Goal**: Replace simple dismiss with math problem requirement

**User Story**: "As a user, when alarm fires, I need to solve 5 math problems to dismiss it"

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Math challenge screen (fullscreen when alarm fires)
- [ ] Random two-digit addition/subtraction problems
- [ ] Number pad input interface (like passcode entry)
- [ ] Progress indicator (1/5, 2/5, etc.)
- [ ] "Wrong, try again" feedback
- [ ] Success screen after 5 correct answers
- [ ] Challenge bypasses simple tap-to-dismiss

**Demo Scenario**: Alarm fires, shows "23 + 47 = ?", solve 5 problems, alarm dismisses

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- Full-screen modal presentations
- Number input on small screens
- Real-time UI updates
- User input validation

---

## Iteration 5: Emergency Escape Hatch üö®
**Goal**: Add safety mechanism for when user can't solve problems

**User Story**: "As a user, if I fail 10 math problems, the alarm should dismiss automatically"

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Failure counter tracking wrong answers
- [ ] Emergency dismiss after 10 consecutive failures
- [ ] Failure indicator in UI ("Attempts: 3/10")
- [ ] Reset failure count on each correct answer
- [ ] Emergency dismiss confirmation/feedback

**Demo Scenario**: Intentionally answer wrong 10 times, watch alarm auto-dismiss with message

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- State management in watch apps
- User safety considerations
- Error handling and recovery

---

## Iteration 6: Basic Vibration Escalation üì≥
**Goal**: Implement gentle-to-strong vibration pattern over time

**User Story**: "As a user, I want the alarm to start gently and get stronger if I don't respond"

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Tiered vibration system (Gentle ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Strong)
- [ ] Time-based escalation (1 min, 2 min intervals)
- [ ] Different haptic patterns for each level
- [ ] Vibration continues during math challenges
- [ ] Stop vibration only on successful completion

**Demo Scenario**: Let alarm run for 3+ minutes, observe escalation from gentle to strong vibration

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- Advanced haptic feedback patterns
- Timer-based state changes
- Background vibration management
- Battery-conscious implementations

---

## Iteration 7: Persistent Alarm Protection üõ°Ô∏è
**Goal**: Prevent accidental dismissal through coverage/gestures

**User Story**: "As a user, I want the alarm to keep going even if I accidentally cover the watch or make gestures"

**Technical Challenge**: Override Apple Watch's built-in "Cover to Mute" behavior and other system dismissal mechanisms

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Bypass "Cover to Mute" system behavior during alarm
- [ ] Disable standard dismiss gestures during alarm
- [ ] Force user to open app to access challenge
- [ ] Ignore crown rotation and button presses
- [ ] Only allow dismissal through completed challenge
- [ ] Visual indicators showing "alarm active" state

**Demo Scenario**: Cover watch face, press buttons, rotate crown - alarm continues until math challenges completed (proving "Cover to Mute" is bypassed)

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- Overriding system behaviors ("Cover to Mute", gesture dismissal)
- App state management and focus
- Custom haptic control vs system notification vibration
- Watch hardware interaction handling
- User experience for critical applications

---

## Iteration 8: Polish & User Experience ‚ú®
**Goal**: Improve overall experience with better UI and feedback

**User Story**: "As a user, I want a polished experience with clear feedback and intuitive interface"

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Improved visual design for all screens
- [ ] Better icons and color coding
- [ ] Loading states and transitions
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for important actions
- [ ] Help/info screens explaining challenge system
- [ ] Sound options (for future non-silent use)

**Demo Scenario**: Complete user journey feels smooth and professional

**Apple Watch Concepts Learned**:
- Watch design guidelines and best practices
- Animations and transitions on watchOS
- Accessibility considerations
- Professional app polish

## Development Guidelines

### Per Iteration Process:
1. **Plan**: Review requirements and design approach
2. **Implement**: Code the features step-by-step with explanations
3. **Test**: Run on simulator and device
4. **Demo**: Show working functionality
5. **Commit**: Version control with clear commit messages
6. **Review**: Assess what worked and what needs adjustment

### Code Quality Standards:
- Follow SwiftUI best practices
- Comment key Apple Watch specific implementations
- Handle edge cases (low battery, app backgrounding, etc.)
- Test on different watch sizes
- Maintain performance (watch apps have strict memory limits)

### Learning Integration:
Each iteration will cover specific concepts from the learning guide, building expertise naturally through practical implementation.
