# GetUpPlease - Requirements Document

## Project Overview
**GetUpPlease** is a custom Apple Watch alarm application designed to solve the problem of accidental alarm dismissal during sleep, ensuring the user is fully awake before stopping.

---

## User Story & Problem Statement

### Primary User
- Sleeps with Apple Watch on
- Uses watch as primary alarm (vibration only, no sound)
- Shares sleeping space (needs silent wake-up)
- Experiences issue with built-in alarm stopping when watch is covered

### Core Problem
The built-in Apple Watch alarm stops vibrating when the watch face is covered or touched, leading to accidental dismissal before the user is fully awake.

**Technical Root Cause**: Apple Watch's "Cover to Mute" feature automatically mutes notifications and sounds when the watch face is covered with palm for 3+ seconds. This system behavior, while useful for normal notifications, causes alarm failures during sleep when users accidentally cover the watch face.

### Solution Goal
Create a persistent alarm system that requires cognitive engagement to dismiss, ensuring the user is mentally alert before the alarm stops.

**Technical Solution**: Bypass Apple's system notification behavior by implementing custom UI and direct haptic control that ignores "Cover to Mute" functionality and other system-level dismissal mechanisms.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Persistent Alarm System
- **Requirement**: Alarm continues vibrating regardless of watch coverage, gestures, or accidental touches
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Technical Note**: Override default watchOS alarm dismissal behaviors

### 2. Cognitive Wake-up Challenge
- **Requirement**: User must solve questions/puzzles to dismiss alarm
- **Priority**: Critical  
- **Purpose**: Ensure mental alertness before alarm stops

### 3. Silent Operation
- **Requirement**: Vibration-only alarm system
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Constraint**: No audio to avoid disturbing sleeping partner

### 4. Sleep-aware Scheduling
- **Requirement**: Set and manage alarm times
- **Priority**: High
- **Details**: Support for multiple alarms, different days, recurring schedules
